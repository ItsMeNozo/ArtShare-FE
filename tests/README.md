# ArtShare E2E Test Suite üé®

A comprehensive end-to-end test suite for the ArtShare application using Playwright.

## üè∑Ô∏è Test Strategy & Categories

Our test suite is organized into three main categories based on cost and safety:

### ü§ñ @ai - AI Tests (Manual Only)

- **Cost**: These tests use AI services and will incur charges
- **Environment**: Any environment
- **Execution**: Manual only - **NEVER run in CI/CD pipeline**
- **Command**: `npm run test:ai`
- **Purpose**: Tests that involve AI image generation, content analysis, or other AI-powered features

### ‚úÖ @safe - Safe Tests (Production Pipeline)

- **Cost**: Free to run
- **Environment**: Production environment (read-only operations)
- **Execution**: Automated in CI/CD pipeline
- **Command**: `npm run test:safe`
- **Purpose**: Tests that verify UI functionality, navigation, and read-only operations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è @unsafe - Unsafe Tests (Preview Environment)

- **Cost**: Free to run
- **Environment**: Preview/test environment
- **Execution**: Automated in CI/CD pipeline
- **Command**: `npm run test:unsafe`
- **Purpose**: Tests that create, update, or delete data; require isolated test environment

### üéØ Available Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests (not recommended for CI)
npm run test

# Run safe tests (production environment)
npm run test:safe

# Run unsafe tests (preview environment)
npm run test:unsafe

# Run AI tests (manual only - costs money!)
npm run test:ai

# Run smoke tests
npm run test:smoke

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui

# Clean up test data
npm run test:cleanup

# Show test report
npm run test:report
```

### üìã Test Tagging Examples

```typescript
// Safe test - can run in production
test('@safe should display landing page correctly', async ({ page }) => {
  // Read-only operations only
});

// Unsafe test - modifies data, needs test environment
test('@unsafe should create new user account', async ({ page }) => {
  // Creates/modifies data
});

// AI test - uses AI services, costs money
test('@ai should generate artwork with AI', async ({ page }) => {
  // Calls AI APIs that cost money
});
```

### üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline Behavior

The GitHub Actions workflow automatically runs:

1. **@safe tests** against the production environment
2. **@unsafe tests** against the preview environment
3. **Test cleanup** to remove any test data

**@ai tests are excluded from the pipeline** to prevent unexpected charges.

## üßπ Test Data Cleanup System

This test suite includes an advanced cleanup system to ensure tests don't leave behind unwanted data.

### Quick Start with Cleanup

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import { TestHelpers } from '../utils/test-helpers';

test.describe('My Test Suite', () => {
  let helpers: TestHelpers;

  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    helpers = new TestHelpers(page);
    await helpers.loginWithTestUser();
  });

  test.afterEach(async () => {
    await helpers.cleanup(); // Automatically cleans up test data
  });

  test('should create a post', async ({ page }) => {
    // Create post and track it for cleanup
    const postId = await helpers.submitPostAndTrack();
    // Post will be automatically deleted after test
  });
});
```

### Available Cleanup Scripts

```bash
npm run test:cleanup          # Verify cleanup status
npm run test:cleanup:posts    # Clean up test posts
npm run test:cleanup:files    # Clean up test files
npm run test:cleanup:all      # Clean up everything
npm run test:integration      # Run integration tests with real data
```

### Environment Setup

Create `.env.test` file:

```bash
TEST_USER_EMAIL=testuser@example.com
TEST_USER_PASSWORD=TestPassword123!
VITE_BE_URL=http://localhost:3000
TEST_CLEANUP_ENABLED=true
```

See the full documentation in this file for advanced usage.

## üöÄ CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Example

```yaml
name: E2E Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Install Playwright
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps

      - name: Run Playwright tests
        run: npx playwright test

      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        if: always()
        with:
          name: playwright-report
          path: playwright-report/
```

## üìù Test Data Management

### Mock Data

Tests use mock API responses to ensure consistent, fast execution. Mock data is defined in `test-helpers.ts`.

### Test Users

Predefined test users for different scenarios:

- Valid user with complete profile
- Invalid user for error testing
- Users for social interaction testing

## üêõ Debugging Tests

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Run specific test in debug mode
npx playwright test auth.spec.ts --debug

# Debug specific test case
npx playwright test -g "should login successfully" --debug
```

### Screenshots for Debugging

The test suite automatically captures screenshots at key points and on failures. Check `test-results/screenshots/` for visual debugging.

### Trace Viewer

```bash
# Open trace viewer for failed tests
npx playwright show-trace test-results/trace.zip
```

## üìã Test Maintenance

### Adding New Tests

1. Identify the user journey or feature to test
2. Add test scenarios to appropriate spec file
3. Use `TestHelpers` for common operations
4. Mock API responses for consistent testing
5. Add responsive testing for mobile features

### Updating Selectors

If UI changes break tests:

1. Use `data-testid` attributes for stable selectors
2. Prefer semantic selectors (role, label) over CSS classes
3. Update selectors in `TestHelpers` for reusability

### Test Data Updates

Update mock data in `test-helpers.ts` when API responses change.

## üéØ Best Practices

### Selector Strategy

1. **Preferred**: `data-testid` attributes
2. **Good**: Semantic selectors (`role`, `aria-label`)
3. **Acceptable**: Stable CSS classes
4. **Avoid**: Dynamic classes, complex CSS selectors

### Test Organization

- Group related tests in `describe` blocks
- Use descriptive test names
- Include both happy path and error scenarios
- Test responsive behavior for key features

### Mock Strategy

- Mock external API calls for consistency
- Use realistic mock data
- Test error scenarios with mock failures
- Avoid mocking internal application logic

## ü§ù Contributing

When adding new tests:

1. Follow existing patterns and structure
2. Add appropriate mock data
3. Include responsive testing for UI features
4. Update this README if adding new test categories
5. Ensure tests pass in all supported browsers

## üóëÔ∏è Detailed Test Data Cleanup Documentation

### System Overview

The test data cleanup system provides automatic cleanup of test data created during E2E tests, including:

- Posts created during tests
- Uploaded files (images, videos, etc.)
- Test users (when applicable)
- Browser storage and cookies

### Key Components

#### TestHelpers Class (`tests/utils/test-helpers.ts`)

- Main helper class for E2E tests
- Provides methods to track created test data
- Handles cleanup during test teardown

#### TestDataCleanup Class (`tests/utils/test-data-cleanup.ts`)

- Advanced cleanup utility with robust error handling
- Supports batch cleanup operations
- Provides cleanup verification

#### Environment Configuration (`.env.test`)

- Configure test environment settings
- Set API endpoints for cleanup
- Enable/disable cleanup features

### Test Types

#### Unit Tests (Mock Mode)

```typescript
test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
  helpers = new TestHelpers(page);
  helpers.enableMockMode(); // Prevents real API calls
  await helpers.setupPostCreationMocks();
});
```

#### Integration Tests (Real Data)

```typescript
test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
  helpers = new TestHelpers(page);
  helpers.disableMockMode(); // Allows real API calls (default)
  await helpers.loginWithTestUser();
});
```

### Manual Tracking

If you need to track data manually:

```typescript
test('manual tracking example', async ({ page }) => {
  // Create post via direct API call
  const postId = '123';
  helpers.trackCreatedPost(postId);

  // Upload file
  const fileUrl = 'https://example.com/uploads/test-image.jpg';
  helpers.trackUploadedFile(fileUrl);

  // Cleanup will handle these automatically
});
```

### Best Practices

#### 1. Always Use Unique Test Data

```typescript
const timestamp = new Date().getTime();
const title = `Test Post ${timestamp}`;
```

#### 2. Proper Error Handling

```typescript
test('should handle failures gracefully', async ({ page }) => {
  try {
    const postId = await helpers.submitPostAndTrack();
    // ... test logic ...
  } catch (error) {
    // Test failed, but cleanup will still happen in afterEach
    console.error('Test failed:', error);
    throw error;
  }
});
```

#### 3. Use Test Tags

```typescript
test('@integration @cleanup Real data test', async ({ page }) => {
  // This test creates real data and requires cleanup
});

test('@unit @mock Unit test', async ({ page }) => {
  helpers.enableMockMode();
  // This test uses mocks, no cleanup needed
});
```

## üë• Team Best Practices

### 1. Always Tag Your Tests

- **@safe**: For read-only operations that can safely run in production
- **@unsafe**: For data-modifying operations that need a test environment
- **@ai**: For features that use AI services (costs money)

### 2. Cost Management

- **Never run @ai tests in CI/CD** - they cost money
- **Use @ai tests sparingly** and only when absolutely necessary
- **Focus AI tests** on core functionality to minimize costs

### 3. Environment Safety

- **@safe tests** should never modify production data
- **@unsafe tests** should only run in preview/test environments
- **Always clean up** after @unsafe tests

### 4. Test Writing Guidelines

- Use descriptive test names that include the tag
- Keep tests focused and atomic
- Use test helpers for common operations
- Include cleanup in test teardown

### 5. Before Committing

- Ensure all tests are properly tagged
- Run tests locally before pushing
- Check that no @ai tests are accidentally included in CI

## üß™ Testing the Pipeline

### How to Test Pipeline Success/Failure

1. **Test Pipeline Success:**

   ```bash
   # Run the pipeline test locally first
   npm run test:safe
   npm run test:unsafe

   # If all pass, commit and push to trigger GitHub Actions
   git add .
   git commit -m "test: verify pipeline success"
   git push
   ```

2. **Test Pipeline Failure:**

   ```bash
   # Temporarily enable the failing test in pipeline-test.spec.ts
   # Uncomment the intentionally failing test:
   # test('@safe should fail - intentional failure test', async ({ page }) => {
   #   await expect(page).toHaveTitle('This Title Does Not Exist');
   # });

   # Then commit and push
   git add .
   git commit -m "test: verify pipeline failure handling"
   git push
   ```

3. **Check Pipeline Status:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click on "Actions" tab
   - View the latest workflow run
   - ‚úÖ Green checkmark = Pipeline passed
   - ‚ùå Red X = Pipeline failed (as expected)

### Pipeline Behavior

- **On Success**: All steps complete, artifacts are uploaded
- **On Failure**: Pipeline stops at the failing step, previous steps' artifacts are still uploaded
- **Always Runs**: Cleanup and artifact upload run even if tests fail

### Local Testing Commands

```bash
# Test the exact same commands that run in pipeline
npx playwright test --grep @safe --reporter=line,html
npx playwright test --grep @unsafe --reporter=line,html
npm run test:cleanup
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Test user credentials
TEST_USER_EMAIL=testuser@example.com
TEST_USER_PASSWORD=TestPassword123!

# Backend API URL
VITE_BE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Cleanup settings
TEST_CLEANUP_ENABLED=true
TEST_VERBOSE_LOGGING=true
TEST_DATA_RETENTION_HOURS=24

# Database connection for direct cleanup (optional)
TEST_DB_URL=postgresql://testuser:testpass@localhost:5432/artshare_test

# File storage settings
TEST_STORAGE_PATH=/tmp/test-uploads
TEST_STORAGE_CLEANUP_ENABLED=true
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Cleanup Not Working?

1. Check if `TEST_CLEANUP_ENABLED=true` in `.env.test`
2. Verify your backend cleanup endpoints are working
3. Check console logs for cleanup errors
4. Run `npm run test:cleanup` to see remaining data

#### Authentication Issues?

```typescript
// Check if auth token is available
const authToken = await page.evaluate(() => {
  return localStorage.getItem('authToken');
});
console.log('Auth token:', authToken);
```

#### Files Not Being Deleted?

1. Check file permissions
2. Verify the cleanup endpoint URL
3. Check if files are actually uploaded to the expected location

### Advanced Features

#### Batch Cleanup

```typescript
// Clean up old test data (older than 24 hours)
await helpers.cleanupUtility.cleanupTestDataByAge(24);
```

#### Cleanup Verification

```typescript
// Verify cleanup was successful
const failed = await helpers.cleanupUtility.verifyCleanup(postIds, fileUrls);
if (failed.posts.length > 0) {
  console.warn('Failed to clean up posts:', failed.posts);
}
```

#### Custom Cleanup Logic

```typescript
class CustomTestHelpers extends TestHelpers {
  async customCleanup() {
    await super.cleanup();
    // Add your custom cleanup logic here
  }
}
```

### Performance Considerations

- Use mock mode for unit tests to avoid cleanup overhead
- Run cleanup verification only in CI environments
- Consider using a dedicated test database that can be easily reset
- Implement cleanup timeouts to prevent hanging tests

### Security Notes

- Never use production credentials in tests
- Use dedicated test accounts with limited permissions
- Consider using temporary/sandbox environments for integration tests
- Regularly audit test data to ensure cleanup is working

### Migration from Old Tests

If you have existing tests without cleanup:

1. Add `TestHelpers` to your test setup
2. Replace direct API calls with `helpers.submitPostAndTrack()`
3. Add `await helpers.cleanup()` in `afterEach`
4. Test the cleanup by running the verification script

This system ensures your E2E tests are clean, isolated, and don't interfere with each other or leave behind test data.
