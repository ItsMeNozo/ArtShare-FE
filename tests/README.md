## üéØ Test Recording with Playwright

### Record New Tests

Use Playwright's codegen tool to record interactions:

```bash
# Record against local app
npx playwright codegen http://localhost:5173

# Record specific page
npx playwright codegen http://localhost:5173/login

# Record with device emulation
npx playwright codegen --device="iPhone 12" http://localhost:5173
```

### Recording Scenarios for Manual Testing

Based on the test scenarios I've created, here are key user flows to record manually:

#### üîê Authentication Scenarios

1. **Happy Path Login**:

   - Navigate to `/login`
   - Fill email and password
   - Submit form
   - Verify redirect to explore page

2. **Registration Flow**:

   - Navigate to `/signup`
   - Fill registration form
   - Handle email verification
   - Complete onboarding profile

3. **Social Login**:
   - Click Google/Facebook login
   - Handle OAuth popup
   - Verify successful login

#### üé® Content Interaction Scenarios

1. **Browse and Like Posts**:

   - Visit explore page
   - Scroll through posts
   - Like/unlike posts
   - View post details

2. **Search Functionality**:

   - Use search bar
   - Enter search terms
   - Browse search results
   - Filter by categories

3. **User Profile Interaction**:
   - Visit user profile
   - Follow/unfollow user
   - Browse user's posts
   - View follower/following lists

#### üì± Mobile-Specific Scenarios

## üîß Test Configuration

### Playwright Configuration

Key settings in `playwright.config.ts`:

- **Base URL**: Automatically points to your local dev server
- **Retries**: 2 retries on CI, 0 locally
- **Parallel Execution**: Full parallel execution for speed
- **Trace Collection**: On first retry for debugging
- **Screenshots**: Only on failure
- **Videos**: Retained on failure

### Custom Test Helpers

The `TestHelpers` class provides utilities for:

- Network request mocking
- Form filling with validation wait
- Authentication state management
- Screenshot capture
- Responsive testing

## üöÄ CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Example

```yaml
name: E2E Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Install Playwright
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps

      - name: Run Playwright tests
        run: npx playwright test

      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        if: always()
        with:
          name: playwright-report
          path: playwright-report/
```

## üìù Test Data Management

### Mock Data

Tests use mock API responses to ensure consistent, fast execution. Mock data is defined in `test-helpers.ts`.

### Test Users

Predefined test users for different scenarios:

- Valid user with complete profile
- Invalid user for error testing
- Users for social interaction testing

## üêõ Debugging Tests

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Run specific test in debug mode
npx playwright test auth.spec.ts --debug

# Debug specific test case
npx playwright test -g "should login successfully" --debug
```

### Screenshots for Debugging

The test suite automatically captures screenshots at key points and on failures. Check `test-results/screenshots/` for visual debugging.

### Trace Viewer

```bash
# Open trace viewer for failed tests
npx playwright show-trace test-results/trace.zip
```

## üìã Test Maintenance

### Adding New Tests

1. Identify the user journey or feature to test
2. Add test scenarios to appropriate spec file
3. Use `TestHelpers` for common operations
4. Mock API responses for consistent testing
5. Add responsive testing for mobile features

### Updating Selectors

If UI changes break tests:

1. Use `data-testid` attributes for stable selectors
2. Prefer semantic selectors (role, label) over CSS classes
3. Update selectors in `TestHelpers` for reusability

### Test Data Updates

Update mock data in `test-helpers.ts` when API responses change.

## üéØ Best Practices

### Selector Strategy

1. **Preferred**: `data-testid` attributes
2. **Good**: Semantic selectors (`role`, `aria-label`)
3. **Acceptable**: Stable CSS classes
4. **Avoid**: Dynamic classes, complex CSS selectors

### Test Organization

- Group related tests in `describe` blocks
- Use descriptive test names
- Include both happy path and error scenarios
- Test responsive behavior for key features

### Mock Strategy

- Mock external API calls for consistency
- Use realistic mock data
- Test error scenarios with mock failures
- Avoid mocking internal application logic

## ü§ù Contributing

When adding new tests:

1. Follow existing patterns and structure
2. Add appropriate mock data
3. Include responsive testing for UI features
4. Update this README if adding new test categories
5. Ensure tests pass in all supported browsers
